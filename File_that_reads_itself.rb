print File.read(__FILE__)

#So I copy and pasted this quine of the internet

# Originally I had planned to try and make my own. 

# The plan was to wrie a ruby program that saves then reads it's self


# File.open("Untitled1.rb", 'r')

# but thats not working nore is that 

# it's 01:48am 10/05/2020 and I need sleep please

# file = File.open("Untitled1.rb", 'r')
# file.close
# file = File.read("Untitled1.rb", 'r')
# file.close

# I think the imaprtant thing is that I understand the question 
# ands that I know why "puts File.read(__FILE__)" is working
